What it is ?
------------
	vm_cdev_dri.c is a simple character device driver module code, whose buffer is allocated using vmalloc. Its buffer size can be configured by writting to /proc/proc_entry.

How to run ? -> ./script
------------
	There is a make file which will produce the kernel object file. That can be inserted into the kernel using insmod and removed using rmmod. Another method is, just run the script (./script). It has all the commands.
